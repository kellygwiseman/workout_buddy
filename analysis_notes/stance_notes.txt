# Armband placement differences

# left arm
• X acceleration component centered at -0.5
• X-Z acc pos correlated, X-Y neg correlated
• X-Y pos correlated, X-Z gyro neg correlated 
• Yaw centered at 2, Roll centered at -1
• Pitch-Roll and Roll-Yaw pos correlated
• Z quat centered at -0.6
• X-Y quat pos correlated, X-Z quat neg correlated, X-W, Y-W, Z-W messy in the  middle
• Z acc filtered smaller

# right arm
• X acceleration component centered at ~0.7
• X-Y acc pos correlated, X-Z neg correlated
• X-Z gyro pos correlated, X-Y neg correlated
• Yaw centered at -2, Roll centered at 1
• Pitch-Roll and Roll-Yaw neg correlated
• Z quat centered at 0.6
• X-Z, X-W, Z-W quat pos correlated, X-Y, Y-W quat neg correlated

##### Kelly Left/Right arm normal stance  comparison ########
# comparable features for both Left and Right arm normal pushups
• comparable: aY, gY (messy, not as useful waveform), pitch
• fairly close: aZ (left has ~40% larger amp), gX (similar shape but left has ~30% larger amp),yaw
• flipped but similar amp: qY (minor flipped component and L ~20% larger), qZ (out of sync and R ~15% larger), gZ, aX
• flipped and different amp: qW (different shape and Right ~70% larger amp)
• very different: qX (in synce different shape and L 200% size), roll (different shape, out of sync and R ~200% size)

###### Beau normal/ narrow comparison (both right arm) ######
• narrow 1/3 slower
• Similar:
	• aZ Norm more complex shape, similar amp
	• aX Nar more complex shape, similar amp
	• aY pretty similar
	• qY 
	• qZ Nar ~20% bigger
	• pitch
	• roll

• Different:
	• gX Norm ~250% size and simpler shape
	• gY Norm ~200% size
	• gZ Norm ~30% bigger and simpler shape, Nar has double peak
	• qX similar amp but Nar has more complex shape (lower second peak)
	• qW Nar 300% size
	• Nar much bigger (1000%) sometimes

### Overall similar features for Left/Right Normal/Narrow ########
• pitch, aY, aZ, qY

####### Dynamic Time Warping steps: ########
• pull out the peaks and choose window to be +- average duration from last and first peak
• scale the features
• interpolate features to be same max length
• calculate distances for pitch, aY, aZ, qY
• do 1 KNN
