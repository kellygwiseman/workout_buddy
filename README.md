#Workout Buddy
=============

A webapp that turns your iPhone into a personal trainer.

#### Inspiration
Often when I go for a long run through Golden Gate Park, I like to stop midway and cross-train.  I already have a fitness device to track my run, but I have no way to record my other exercises.

I developed Workout Buddy to fill this gap by providing detailed tracking and assessment of basic exercises. The beta version starts by analyzing pushups repetitions, but product extensions could include situps, pullups, squats, etc.  Workout Buddy uses equipment that most fitness lovers already have, your smart phone and an armband.  
 
#### Sensor Data
Workout Buddy uses your phone's accelerometer and gyro sensor. 

#### Signal Processing

#### Repetition Detection

#### Exercise Classification and Rating

#### Interactive Visualizations
